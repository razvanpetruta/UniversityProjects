In the last few weeks of pursuing the OOP course, we learnt how to use the Qt Framework in order to build graphical user interfaces, and also learnt some design patterns like:

 - Model View Controller Architecture ([see example](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Object_Oriented_Programming/ScreenWriter-ModelViewController))
