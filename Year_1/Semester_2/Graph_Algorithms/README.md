### Labs:
 - [Lab1](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Graph_Algorithms/Lab1) - create basic operations for graph implementation
 - [Lab2](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Graph_Algorithms/Lab2) - write a program that finds the connected components of an undirected graph using a depth-first traversal of the graph
 - [Lab3](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Graph_Algorithms/Lab3) - write a program that, given a graph with costs that has no negative cost cycles and two vertices, finds a lowest cost walk between the given vertices. The program shall use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm
 - [Lab4](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Graph_Algorithms/Lab4) - Write a program that, given a list of activities with duration and list of prerequisites for each activity, does the following:
    - verify if the corresponding graph is a DAG and performs a topological sorting of the activities using the algorithm based on depth-first traversal (Tarjan's algorithm);
    - prints the earliest and the latest starting time for each activity and the total time of the project;
    - prints the critical activities;
 - [Lab5](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Graph_Algorithms/Lab5) - given an undirected graph, find a clique of maximum size
