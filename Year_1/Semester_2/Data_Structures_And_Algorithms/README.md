### Labs:
 - [Lab1](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Data_Structures_And_Algorithms/Lab1_ADT_Bag) - ADT Bag represented as a dynamic array of unique elements (U) and a dynamic array of positions (P) in U of the elements from the Bag
 - [Lab2](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Data_Structures_And_Algorithms/Lab2_ADT_Multimap) - ADT MultiMap – using a SLL with unique keys. Every key will be associated with a SLL of the values belonging to that key
 - [Lab3](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Data_Structures_And_Algorithms/Lab3_ADT_SortedList) - ADT SortedList (interface with TPozition = Iterator, SortedIteratedList) – using a SLLA where elements are ordered based on a relation
 - [Lab4](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Data_Structures_And_Algorithms/Lab4_ADT_Bag) - ADT Bag – using a hashtable with coalesced chaining in which the elements are stored. If an element appears multiple times, it will be stored multiple times in the hashtable
 - [Lab5](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_1/Semester_2/Data_Structures_And_Algorithms/Lab5_ADT_SortedBag) - ADT SortedBag – using a BST with linked representation with dynamic allocation. If an element appears multiple times, it will be stored multiple times in the BST.
