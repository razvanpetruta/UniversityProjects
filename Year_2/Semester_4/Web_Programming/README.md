### Labs:
 - [A1-HTML](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_2/Semester_4/Web_Programming/A1-HTML) - Create a single HTML web page for a subject you like (e.g. personal home page, photo collection, movie stars, cars etc.). You can NOT use any CSS or Javascript on your web page! Only basic HTML language. The web page should be HTML5 valid. You will have to use the following HTML tags in your web page: <img>,<a>,<table>,<br>,<hr>,<p>,<b>,<div>,<ul>, <li>,<section>,<article>,<footer>,<header>,<aside>,<nav>, <svg>,<audio>,<video>,<figure>,<figurecaption>,<main>. Also you should specify the type of document using <!Doctype>. The page must be at least one screen long and at most 2 screens long (using a resolution of 1024x768 pixels). The textual content of the page should be relevant to the chosen subject (not "lorem ipsum" text). <br/><br/> This single web page can be edited using any editor you want and can be presented on any browser you prefer.
 - [A2-CSS_simple](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_2/Semester_4/Web_Programming/A2-CSS_simple): 
    -  6 - Write a web page which contains a table. This table should be formatted using a style sheet. When the mouse is over the table, the table should collapse to the table header. This collape operation should be done with transitions/animations. 
    -  19 - Using divs and shadows write a web page which shows stairs in 3D.
 - [A3-CSS_layouts](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_2/Semester_4/Web_Programming/A3-CSS_layouts) - Develop an html+css web document that looks like the following web page: https://www.python.org/. You should clone about one screen of this web page (not the whole web page) and your html document should look approximately 90% as the given web page. No interactivity should be added (e.g. javascript, :hover effects etc.) and you are not allowed to use any css or javascript library. 
 - [A4-JS](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_2/Semester_4/Web_Programming/A4-JS) - Write a javascript which sorts in ascending order an array of numbers which are introduced by the user in a "textarea" or "input type=text" tag. The sorted array (which can have any length) will be displayed in a <table> with 5 columns and n/5 lines where n is the length of the array.
 - [A5-JQuery](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_2/Semester_4/Web_Programming/A5-JQuery) - Solve the following task using only the jQuery library (production version, jquery.min.js, or developement version, jquery.js); YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY OTHER JS LIBRARY, PLUGIN OR EXTENSION BESIDES THE JQUERY LIBRARY. Write a web page which displays a horizontally sliding desktop like the ones used on the Android or iOS. The web page should have 4 desktops, each desktop having a distinct transparent background color or image and having distinct textual and image content. A desktop is a large div occupying (exactly or almost) the whole browser window. By default, desktop no. 1 should be shown to the user. If the user clicks somewhere on the desktop the desktop should be slided horizontally to the right and from the left desktop no. 2 should slide horizontally and occupy the whole browser window. Desktop sliding should be an animated transition and one desktop should not just instantly dissapear and the next desktop be displayed instead.
 - [A7-PHP-AJAX](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_2/Semester_4/Web_Programming/A7-PHP-AJAX) - Write a web application for managing books in a personal library. The application should maintain various information about a book in the database (i.e. author, title, pages, genre etc.). The application should implement: book browsing (use AJAX for retrieving books from a specific category/genre), adding, removing, updating a book, lending books. Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. category/genre), should be displayed (do this in javascript).
 - [A8-PHP-Angular](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_2/Semester_4/Web_Programming/A8-PHP-Angular) - Develop an Angular UI (user interface) for the PHP lab task you have solved for Lab7. So, the problem you need to solve for this lab will be the same problem you had for Lab7 (PHP, Ajax, JSON), the backend of the solution will be the same (i.e. the php code), but you have to change the frontend (html, css, javascript part) to be an Angular application.
 - [A9-Java-Spring-Boot](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_2/Semester_4/Web_Programming/A9-Java-Spring-Boot) - Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database; you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. Write a web application for user profile management. Before he can use the application, the user must be authenticated or he has the option of creating a new account (i.e. register). The profile of a user contains the fields: name, email address, picture, age, home town. A user can search the profile database using any of the above fields or parts of a field. The profiles resulted from the search are displayed on the browser window: the image, name, email address, age and home town. Image files need not be stored on the database. A user can also change its profile data.
 - [A10-AspNet-Core-WebAPI](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_2/Semester_4/Web_Programming/A10-AspNet-Core-WebAPI) - Solve the same problem you got for the PHP lab, but using the ASP .NET technology. In addition to the specification for the PHP lab, your application must implement user authentication and ask the user to authenticate himself/herself prior to actually using the web application (based on an username and password saved in the database).
 - [Exam](https://github.com/razvanpetruta/UniversityProjects/tree/main/Year_2/Semester_4/Web_Programming/Exam) - You can find the statement in the Exam folder.
