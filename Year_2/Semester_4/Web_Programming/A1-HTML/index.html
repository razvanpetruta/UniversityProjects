            <h3>WHO IS JORDAN PETERSON?</h3>
            <p>Jordan Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist, cultural critic, and professor of psychology at
                the University of Toronto. He first gained widespread attention in 2016 for his opposition to a
                proposed Canadian law that he argued would compel speech and for his subsequent viral videos
                criticizing political correctness and identity politics. Peterson has authored several books,
                including "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos," which has become a bestseller in several
                countries. He is known for his controversial views on gender, political correctness, and free speech,
                which have led to both criticism and support from various communities.
