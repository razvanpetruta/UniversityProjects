A client server implementation in python for the number guess problem. The server chooses a random number. 
The clients connect and send numbers to server. The server returns to each client a status message:
‘H’ – send a larger number
‘S’ – send a lower number
‘G’ – you guessed my number
‘L’ – another client guessed the number. You are a looser !
The implementation bellow is a concurrent multithreaded - didactic approach to the problem – not checking for every possible error. 
Also pay attention to thread synchronization mechanisms and the way a simple solution becomes complicated when threads need to be synchronized
